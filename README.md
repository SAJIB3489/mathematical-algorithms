This repository serves as a playground and a comprehensive resource for understanding the professional course called `Mathematical Algorithms`.

It is designed to help learners and practitioners explore, implement, and experiment with a wide range of algorithms that are fundamental to mathematics and computer science. The repository includes well-documented code examples, explanations, and problem-solving techniques that are commonly covered in a `Mathematical Algorithms` course.


**Course Lecturer:** Osman Torunoglu
