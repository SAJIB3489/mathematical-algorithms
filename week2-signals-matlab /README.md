# Short description of each Singal

#### 1. Unit Impulse Signal
I understand that the impulse signal is zero everywhere except at ``t=0``, where it has an infinitely large value. In MATLAB it is shown as a single spike at zero.

#### 2. Unit Step Signal
I learned that the step signal stays at ``0`` for ``t<0`` and suddenly jumps to 1 for t≥0. It shows a switching action.

#### 3. Unit Ramp Signal
I understand that the ramp signal is zero before ``t=0`` and increases linearly with time after zero. It shows a continuous growth starting at the origin.

#### 4. Exponential Signal
I learned that the exponential signal changes based on the parameter ``a``. If a is negative, the signal decays, and if ``a`` is positive, it grows. It shows natural growth or decay.

#### 5. Signum Signal
I understand that the signum signal shows the sign of time. It gives -1 for negative time, ``0`` at ``t=0``, and +1 for positive time.

#### 6. Sinc Signal
I learned that the sinc signal is defined as 
``sin⁡(πt)/πt``. It shows oscillations that decay as time increases and is very important in signal processing.
